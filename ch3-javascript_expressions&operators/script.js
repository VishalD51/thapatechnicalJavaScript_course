"use strict";
5 + 20;
// here 5 is operand, + is operator and 20 is operand.
// and combination of operator and operand are called expressions.

// If you want to use === or == operator to compare x and y values then it will only work when they are not concatenated with
// anyone and is printed seperately. Example -
const x = 5;
const y = 5;
console.log("is x equals to y? " + x === y); // it retuens false.
console.log(x === y); // it returns true.



// There are 6 types of expressions in JavaScript-
