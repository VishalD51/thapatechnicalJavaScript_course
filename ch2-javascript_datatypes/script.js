// In Javascript, we exclusively do not define the data type of the variable seperately.
// It is because it can automatically determine the data type of a variable.
// Which can be a problem for a begonner to understand and in some cases for the experienced developer too.
// So, there is a typeof() operator in JavaScript which determins the data type of a variable.

//example -
const age = 26;
console.log(typeof age);
